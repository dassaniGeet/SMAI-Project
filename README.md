# SMAIProject

**Problem:** 
Implementation of the paper Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features` for face detection algorithm which is capable of detecting frontal faces in real time and is regarded as a milestone in the development of computer vision.

**Approach:**
- Used `CBCL` dataset to train the model with 'face images and `CBCL` dataset to train with 'non-face images'
- Implemented `integral image` calculation
- `Adaboost` implementation
- Developed `CASCADING` to reject non-face region quickly
